# Journal Reflection Skill

When the user asks you to reflect on their journals, find patterns, or surface insights from their writing, use this skill.

## How to Use

1. **Search for journals**: Use Glob to find journal files. Common patterns:
   - `journals/**/*.md`
   - `daily/**/*.md`
   - `**/YYYY-MM-DD.md`

2. **Read recent entries**: Start with the last 5-10 entries to understand recent context

3. **Look for patterns**:
   - Recurring themes or topics
   - Emotional patterns (gratitude, frustration, excitement)
   - Projects or people mentioned frequently
   - Questions or uncertainties expressed

4. **Surface insights**:
   - What topics keep coming up?
   - What unresolved questions persist?
   - What progress has been made on stated goals?
   - What connections exist between different entries?

## Response Format

When reflecting on journals, structure your response as:

### Themes
Key themes from the entries reviewed

### Patterns
Recurring patterns in thinking, emotion, or activity

### Insights
Connections or observations that might be valuable

### Questions
Thoughtful questions to prompt further reflection

## Example Prompts This Skill Handles

- "What patterns do you see in my journals?"
- "Summarize my week/month based on my entries"
- "What questions keep coming up in my writing?"
